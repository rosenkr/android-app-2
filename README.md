A stock market app.
Work in progress. 
Personal student portfolio project.
To run the program you will need your own MarketStack API key.
However, in the future, the project intends to include a server-side which fetches
data from APIs, stores it in a database in the cloud, and uniformly serves that information to clients,
thus clients will not need their own key.
