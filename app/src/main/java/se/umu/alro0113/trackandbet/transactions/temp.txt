Stats is a screen on the bottom nav bar which intends to show historic data for a
particular user (ROI, number of trades made, total return/loss, etc)

For now, I will use a local cache using Room database locally.
Benefits is that user can close app completely and still see their stats when enter app
Currently 1 user per phone, as I have no way to distinguish users

In the long run, a local cache may be undesired, as I intend on having a remote database
storage.

a local cached pages content can have pulldown to refresh which either makes a new api call
to update the cache, or updates the local cache with data from a a remote db
(depending on what table/info we are talking about)

Stats table should relate to a Transaction table somehow.
