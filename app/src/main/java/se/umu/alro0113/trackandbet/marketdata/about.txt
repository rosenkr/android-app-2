With the two api calls, I can :
Create a LazyList of just the tickers for an exchange (lets add a dropdown
where user can swap exchanges too)
and then the user can press a ticker in the list, and
then a new api call is made for the specific ticker, which contains
extended information, and this is encapsulated in my Ticker(!) data class
The question is, do I really even need to have that Ticker class?
Since all the data is already encapsulated in TickerData in MarketStackApiResponses.kt
Because the TickerResponse has a list of 100 recent trading days
and I can just access the "recent" actual Ticker as : val x = TickerResponse.data[0]
and then x.date, x.price, etc...
