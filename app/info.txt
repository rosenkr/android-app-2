Jetpack Compose
Ktor as server-side proxy to handle client requests for data
sends API requests at 9AM, 11AM, 1PM, 3PM and 5.30PM, local Sweden time.
This is because I have only 100 free HTTP API requests per month from MarketStack.com, where I
have an API key to my name.
The proxy is hosted on the cloud using Google Cloud Platform (Google App Engine)
The data from a request is cached in a database on the cloud.

@Not sure@ The proxy does not forward API requests, it makes requests on a set timer.
Instead, it feeds responses from the requests to?:
1. A variable that holds a list of the ticker values for the day (a very small amount of
data shared by all clients, database not required?)
2. Database required? Google CloudSQL -> Postgres
